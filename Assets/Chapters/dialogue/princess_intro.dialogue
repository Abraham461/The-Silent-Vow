Zakcoff: Elira... you're alive. You’re... not chained?

Princess: They didn't force me. Not at first. They showed me the truth — the world is broken, Zakcoff. Peace is a lie that keeps us weak.

Zakcoff: That’s not you talking. That’s them. You’re stronger than their poison.

Princess:  You think I wanted this? I prayed you'd come… But I’ve seen too much. If I flee, they’ll burn everything. If I stay...

Malrik: Ah, the knight arrives. The vow-bearer. The perfect vessel. The girl has the blood. But you... you have the will. The Hollow Star requires both.

Princess: No! You said it would be me!

Malrik: We lied. His vow binds him to her. That bond will awaken the star.

Narration: The corrupted magic begins draining Zakcoff’s life force. 

Princess: Don’t give in! I was going to die to save the kingdom, not… not you!

Zakcoff:  Then let me keep my vow... just once more.

Princess: I never told you… I loved you. Since we were children.

Zakcoff:  Then I die with no regrets.
