King Solomon: Zakcoff. I had hoped the sword would never leave your sheath again.

Zakcoff: If I must draw it to serve the crown, I will.

King Solomon: They took Elira… my daughter. My only heir. Monsters dragged her into the northern fog.

King Solomon:  I fear a greater darkness moves beneath this attack.

King Solomon:  I command you — bring her back. Protect her. With your life, if you must.

Zakcoff: Your Majesty, I gave my vow the day I swore my knighthood. I will not return without her.

King Solomon: Then may the gods protect you both. And may your vow remain unbroken.
