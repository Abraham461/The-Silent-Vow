NPCTurn back, knight. This forest eats the brave and spits out the mad.

Zakcoff: Kaelen? You were lost in the marshlands.

Kaelen: No. I was given a new path... by them. By the Hollow Star.

Kaelen:  Elira walks willingly toward her fate. She sees more clearly now. Why don’t you join us, Zakcoff? Drop the sword. End your vow.

Zakcoff:  "I don’t betray my vows. Or my kingdom. Or her."
